The Tripal File module supports association of data files with content in a Chado database and for integration of those associations with content types on a Tripal website.

These associations are meant to support [FAIR data principles](<https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>) by integrating with Tripal content web services such that:

- Files are findable and accessible via Tripal's content web services.
- Metadata about files use globally unique controlled vocabularies. These metadata can be assigned as properties of each file.   
- License and usage details can be assigned to each file.

This module provides two new content types for Tripal sites: File and License.  

Development of the Tripal File module was funded by the [National Science Foundation award #1659300](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1659300) and the [National Research Support Program (NRSP) 10 project](https://www.nrsp10.org/) and the McIntire-Stennis project 1019284.
